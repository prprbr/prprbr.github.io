About 5000 people with shared interest in computer vision and machine learning flocked to the beautiful shores of Honolulu to attend the CVPR 2017 conference. I was privileged to attend this week long discussion and demonstration on some of the cutting edge research in the field. In this blog post, I present some of the interesting highlights of the conference.
