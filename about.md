Hello everyone, my name is Pratik Prabhanjan Brahma and this is my blog. I am a research engineer at Volkswagen Electronics Research Lab. I did my Bachelors' and Masters' from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur and I received my PhD degree last year from University of Florida, Gainesville. I am interested in various domains of machine learning and I would love to share my learnings with all of you through this blog. If you want to know more about me and my research prior to last year, please visit [my homepage](https://sites.google.com/site/pratikprabhanjanbrahma/). If you want to know me professionally, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pratik-prabhanjan-brahma-065b7631/) too.
